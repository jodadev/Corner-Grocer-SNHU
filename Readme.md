# Corner Grocer (Console App)

* **Project Summary** : An item-tracking program for "Corner Grocer" to analyze daily purchase records, identifying the frequency of each item purchased to assist in optimizing store layout.
* **Strengths** : created a user-friendly interface that is modular and contains well-organized code through effective use of the `ItemTracker` class for encapsulating functionality.
* **Areas for Enhancement** :

  * Improve error handling and input validation, especially in file reading and data processing, to better manage malformed data and unexpected file formats.
  * Optimize performance for handling larger datasets by exploring more efficient data structures or algorithms.
  * Enhance cross-platform compatibility to ensure seamless operation across Windows, Linux, and macOS without manual code modifications.
  * Colored console to distingish the difference in prompts and system responses to increase UX.
* **Challenges and Solutions** : Handling unstructured text files and varying data formats was challenging. Overcame this by implementing flexible data parsing and processing, and experimentation with string manipulation and file I/O.
* **Transferable Skills** :
  The ability to process and analyze data from files, applicable in data analysis and backend development.

  * Utilization of OOP principles, fundamental across many programming languages and projects.
  * Designing user-friendly interfaces, valuable in web and application development contexts.
* **Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability** :

  * Organized code into well-defined classes and functions for clarity and ease of modification.
  * Used inline comments and documented methods for better understanding and future reference.
  * Adopted consistent naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes to enhance code approachability and readability.
